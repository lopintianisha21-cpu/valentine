            I don’t know how to put everything into words,  
            but every little moment with you means the world to me.  
            You make me smile when I’m tired, you calm me when I’m overthinking,  
            and you feel like home in ways I never expected.  
            This is just a small letter, but my feelings for you are endless. 💖
            <br><br>
            Yours always 💕
